Variable is the container store the values. It is also used for accesing and manipulating the data.
There are 3 types of variables 
VAR: It is used to declare a variable that can be re assign and re declare it is asfuction scope or global scope
Here LET and CONST are not able t to re declare and LET it can be re assign but CONST cannot be re assign
LET is the block scope one where CONST is also a block scope one 
Here these are main diffrences from VAR, LET and CONST 
EXAMPLES:
var x =20;
let y =30;
const z =40;

Example for Scope 
function example() {
    var a= 20;
    let b = 30;
    if (ture){
        var c =40;// here we declared the c value again that means here re assign is done 
        let d = 50; //  here also we re assign going on and re declaration is cannot be done 815
        Console.log(d);//50 Let is the block scope element if we given out side the block it will give as a not defined
    }
    console.log(a);//20
    console.log(b);//30
    console.log(c);//40
}

Example of re-declaration and re-assignment
var e = 50; // var can be re-declaredAdd commentMore actions
var e = 60; // re-declaration is allowed
let f = 70; // let can be re-assigned
f = 80; // re-assignment is allowed
// const g = 90; // const cannot be re-declared or re-assigned
// const g = 100; // SyntaxError: Identifier 'g' has already been declared
// g = 110; // TypeError: Assignment to constant variable
 console.log(e); // 60
 console.log(f); // 80
 console.log(g);//  90
RULES FOR NAMING VARIABLES:Add commentMore actions
1. Variable names can contain letters, digits, underscores (_), and dollar signs ($).
 2. Variable names must start with a letter, underscore (_), or dollar sign ($).
 3. Variable names cannot start with a digit.
 4. Variable names are case-sensitive (e.g., myVar and myvar are different variables).
5. Variable names cannot be a reserved keyword (e.g., var, let, const, function, if, else, etc.).
 6. Variable names should be descriptive and meaningful to improve code readability.
 7. Variable names should not contain spaces or special characters (except for underscores and dollar signs).
 8. Variable names should not exceed a reasonable length to maintain clarity and avoid confusion.
 9. It is a good practice to use camelCase for variable names (e.g., myVariableName) for better readability.
 10. Avoid using single-letter variable names except for loop counters or temporary variables (e.g., i, j, k).
